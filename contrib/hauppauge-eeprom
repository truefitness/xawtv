Subject: Roger's complete Hauppauge EEPROM info

Olivier, Gerd and V4L developers.

Here is my list of the Hauppauge EEPROM contents which I built up for
the
FreeBSD bt848 driver.

If you want further details, I can provide about 20 EEPROM contents
dumps from
different USA and European cards.
I also have email contacts inside Hauppauge who can supply info when we
require it.
Special thanks to Steve Passe, Amancio Hasty and Randall Hopper and all
the others
who send in EEPROM contents to me or to the FreeBSD multimedia list.

There are 5 datablocks, each can vary in size.

Block 1
=======
This is of the format
84 11 00 00 04 followed by 15 bytes
or
84 12 00 00 05 followed by 16 bytes

In this block,
byte 6 is the chipset type (see below)
byte 9 is the tuner type (see below)
byte 11 and 12 are the model number
I'm sure byte 13 is the revision but I cannot decode it.

There is also a byte which reports the ability to get Radio but I've
forgotten it.


Block 2
=======
84 0a 00 01 01 20 77 00 40
This seems to be common for all cards

Block 3
=======
84 then 3 bytes
Bytes 1,2 and 3 are the serial number

Block 4
=======
This varies if you have No Stereo decoder, TDA decoder or MSP decoder
Within this block, byte 3 tells us the stereo decoder chip type (or no
stereo decoder)

If byte 3 is 00 == No stereo decoder chip. The block is 5 bytes. EG.
74 02 01 00 03

If byte 3 indicates a MSP chip, the block is 5 bytes, EG
74 02 01 06 02

If byte 3 indicates a TDA chip, the block is 8 bytes, EG
77 02 01 03 03 43 17 12
byte 5, 6 and 7 are used in programming the TDA (the TDA dbx alignment
bytes).
Each TDA chip needs different values found during card calibration at
Hauppage.


Block 5
=======
This is
79 followed by a one byte checksum

Free Space
==========
the remainer of the eeprom is either filled with 00 or with ff.



Missing Info
------------
I cannot work out the bits which tell me
a) presence of SVIDEO
b) presence of Teletext decoder

The decode table you need for the chip type, tuner type and steroe chip
are
Chipset byte
0  Reserved
1  BT815
2  BT817
3  BT819
4  BT815A
5  BT817A
6  BT819A
7  BT827
8  BT829
9  BT848
a  BT848A
b  BT849A
c  BT829A
d  BT827A
e  BT878
f  BT879
10 BT880

BUT only 0x09 and 0x0e have been used.
