Subject: Video4Linux BTTV(Bt848) Driver for Mash

I've taken the video-grabber code developed by
Gerd Knorr and have Mashified it so that there is
now a new Video-4-Linux BTTV (Bt848) video capture
driver available for the Mash development environment.

See

  http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~kraxel/linux/

under the section "Xawtv" for the low level BTTV driver
that this package calls.

You can, for example, construct a Mash version of Vic
using this new code. More information on Mash is at

  http://www-mash.cs.berkeley.edu/mash/

Since I'm not a regular Mash developer (which is to say
once step above clueless) any feedback or error reports
would be appreciated.

Hank
