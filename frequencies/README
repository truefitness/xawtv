About adding new lists here ...

 (1) Check that there isn't already a list which works for you.  Often
     the same frequency lists are used in multiple countries, so you
     can try if one of some other country near to you works.

 (2) A reason for tuning not working (or not fully working, i.e. fails
     for some frequency ranges) also might be that the tuner
     configuration of the device driver isn't correct.  Try to fix
     your setup first instead of trying to create a new list which is
     bug-compatible to your broken setup.

 (3) There are some lists for common stuff.  The UHF channels are in
     uhf.list for example.  You can simply #include these.  That will
     save you some typing work and also makes the lists more readable.

 (4) Giving some reference (URL to your cable provider for example) for
     the new list highly increases the chance of getting this included.
